Some explanations:
1."strip" is an empty div used to indicate the top of the page
2.The content part is divided into 3: "top of the page", "middle side of the page", "bottom side of the page". Every one of them uses the flexbox display.
3."top of the page" has 2 parts: "top left side", "top right side". They use both id and class for further customisation.
4."middle side of the page" is has 3 parts: "middle left side", "middle center side", "middle right side". All of them use flex.
5."middle left side" has identical items.
6."middle center side" has 2 parts: "header in the middle", "middle content".
7."header in the middle" contains the header constraint by a box on top while "middle content" is where the rest of the content is.
8."middle right side" has 3 parts: "middle right top", "middle right center", "middle right bottom". Two of them use the same class and all 3 of them also have their own id for further customisation.
9. "middle right bottom" doesn't use the same class other items do because it has a different structure.
10."bottom side of the page" has the "bottom boxes" part with the flexbox layout. It also has a plain text part.
